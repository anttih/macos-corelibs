# Mac OS core libraries

Type-safe Haskell bindings to C-based frameworks of the Apple Mac OS SDK. Most
notably, the library offers bindings to

* CoreFoundation
* CoreGraphics
* Carbon Accessibility

This library is unstable, experimental, WIP, and under active testing. Rely upon
it with great care, and definitely avoid it in serious/production code.

The bindings do not cover the all of the target frameworks, and it is likely
they will never reach 100% coverage. Additions may nevertheless happen, and PRs
adding functionality or even additional frameworks are very welcome.
